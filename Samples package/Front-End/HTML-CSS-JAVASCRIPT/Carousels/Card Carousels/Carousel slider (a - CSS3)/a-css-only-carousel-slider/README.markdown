# A CSS-only Carousel Slider

I've recently read about and discussed CSS Scroll Snapping so often that I felt like I should build a CSS-only carousel based on it.

Here are a few things to note:

Accessibility is in line with all other CSS-only experiments: it can only be considered mediocre in term of semantics and visual indicators. Don't do this in production.

The going forward and back is done via a combination of [CSS Scroll Snap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Scroll_Snap) together with [`scroll-behavior: smooth`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-behavior) and moving the focus through the slides via anchor links. 

The nicest trick I pull off is the one for the auto-forward: 

1. first I slowly offset the scroll snap points to the right, making the scroll area follow along due to being snapped to them.
2. after having scrolled the width of a whole slide, I deactivate the snapping. The scroll area is now untied from the scroll snap points.
3. Now I let the scroll snap points jump back to their initial positions without them "snap-dragging" the scroll area back with them
4. Then I re-engage the snapping which now lets the scroll area snap to a different snap point ðŸ¤¯ Whatever... look at the code ðŸ™ƒ
